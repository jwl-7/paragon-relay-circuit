# Paragon Relay Circuit

advanced distributed relay architecture leveraging recursive signal propagation with adaptive feedback loops and dynamic protocol layering

---

## Architectural Overview

The Paragon Relay Circuit (PRC) is architected as a multi-tiered, heterarchical relay topology wherein each nodal unit concurrently assumes receptor and transmitter roles, facilitating intricate bi-directional recursive data flux. Signal transmissions are encapsulated within stratified, dynamically modulated protocol wrappers, perpetually refined by emergent, feedback-driven heuristic metrics—enabling non-linear system self-regulation and recursive oscillatory stability within complex signal cascades.
